## :heavy_check_mark: Task 0 (get familiar with Git and GitHub)

- Thanks to this course I learnt to make a pull request from other's repo

- The existance of Git errors surprised me pretty much

- I discovered how to compare files in console (before I compared them on github) and for sure I will use this and many useful  things that I have learnt from udacity lessons

- 	Parts about redirecting inputs and outputs, configuring environment were new to me (before I worked only several times with nano files).
-	I was surprised how many things can be done with the help of a command line.
-	I'm glad that I had a chance to find out about such useful commands and for sure I will be more confident to work with nano and command line in general.
