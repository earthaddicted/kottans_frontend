## :heavy_check_mark: Git and GitHub

- Thanks to this course I learnt to make a pull request from other's repo

- The existance of Git errors surprised me pretty much

- I discovered how to compare files in console (before I compared them on github) and for sure I will use this and many useful  things that I have learnt from udacity lessons

## :heavy_check_mark: Linux CLI, and HTTP

:paperclip: ![Screenshot](task_linux_cli/LearnTheCommandLine|Codecademy.png)
- 	Parts about redirecting inputs and outputs, configuring environment were new to me (before I worked only several times with nano files).
-	I was surprised how many things can be done with the help of a command line.
-	I'm glad that I had a chance to find out about such useful commands and for sure I will be more confident to work with nano and command line in general.


## :heavy_check_mark: Git Collaboration

:paperclip: ![Screenshot](task_git_collaboration/VersionControlwithGit-Udacity.png)

- It was useful to refresh memories about git push/pull/merge commands and to practice forking of other repo
- Before I never gave a thought that git pull is really the same as a combination of git fetch and git merge
- For sure I will try to use what I've learned in these courses


## :heavy_check_mark: Intro to HTML and CSS

:paperclip: ![Screenshot](task_git_html_css_intro/IntrotoHTMLandCSS-Udacity.jpg)
:paperclip: ![Screenshot](task_git_html_css_intro/HTMLAcademy_HTML_CSS.jpg)

- it was good to practice all these basic html/css rules
-
- I gladly repeat basics because in daily life when you have monotonous tasks sometimes such basics just sleep out of your mind that's why I think it is necessery to repeat them


## :heavy_check_mark: Responsive Web Design

:paperclip: ![Screenshot](task_responsive_web_design/flexboxfroggy.jpg)
:paperclip: ![Screenshot](task_responsive_web_design/ResponsiveWebDesignFundamentals-Udacity.jpg)


- it was good to learn deeper about responsive design, I learned it all by practice before and it was good to compare and check all what I knew already and what udemy teaches and learn it from another angle,
also I found out another way to make responsible table

- Before I used metatag for viewport but never really gave a thought about dip (device independent pixels) and how can they differ from hardware pixels and how much this metatag makes life easier


## :heavy_check_mark: JS Basics
- I read a lot of JS basics (books, materials on websites), but without a continuous practice can say that it is mostly useless thing because you forget it in a while, it is really cool to do practice tasks, for example, conditions in Udacity, I had big fun solving quizes :)
